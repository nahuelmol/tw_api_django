# tw_api_django
## What it is:
That is an basic example about the web app and microservices based on the consuming of differents APIs. With Django its easy to modularize a project, and localy that provides us the use of proxy servers and wsgi, for this imma use:
* NGINX
* waitress (wsgi)
## Goals
i am using the spaceX api, where we can get launch data from an specific link in the oficial page of SpaceX
* The idea is reach the modularization out, creating an app specialize in consuming of this API
With twitter:
* Later i tought in the integration of an tw bot natively with python
Integration:
* And as late step, gathering all the differents services in one as mainly i want to 

## Thanks
